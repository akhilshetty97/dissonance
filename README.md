Dissonance: An Immersive Webpage

Introduction:
"Dissonance" is an immersive installation that visually represents the concept of cognitive dissonance through four interlinked and cyclical phases: Consistency, Chaos, Turmoil, and Adaptation. Each phase is depicted through unique visual animations, ranging from calm blues to raging scarlets, to embody their essence on hovering over the phases.
The webpage was created using Reactjs and Tailwind CSS, featuring a responsive design that adapts to both desktop and mobile views.
